Sometimes houdini labs doesn't generate the neccessary config files for zbrush go-z,
to fix you should copy the houdini folder into your zbrush go-z apps folder - which is usually C:\Users\Public\Pixologic\GoZApps
Then change the path in the config file in the houdini folder to the location of your houdini application
Location is usually C:\Program Files\Side Effects Software\Houdini 21.0.440\bin.houdini.exe - Replace version number with your version

- Follow the same process for any of the other go-z apps in the folder
